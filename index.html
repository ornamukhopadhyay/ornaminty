      <h3 id="list-accomplish">👩🏼‍🔬🙌🏼 Here is a timeline of her life, work, and accomplishments:</h3>
      <li><strong>1920</strong> Born to a British-Jewish family.</li>
      <li>Her family had hosted Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. </li>
      <li>Went to St. Paul's Girls School. Fluent in French + German, topped classes, and won annual awards. Won a scholarship, but gave to refugee students. </li>
       <li><strong>1938</strong> Started studying chemistry at Cambridge + spectroscopic techniques under Dr. Bill Price. Also met with Adrienne Weill in last year @ Cambridge, who was a student of Marie Curie + had a huge influence on life. </li>
      <li><strong>1942</strong> After a failed year in a lab post-graduation, she worked as an assistant research officer for Britain during WW2 + with cousin Irene, was an Air Raid Warden.</li>
      <li><strong>1945</strong> Got her PHd Thesis on <i>The physical chemistry of solid organic colloids with special reference to coal.</i></li>
      <li><strong>1946</strong> Worked in Paris on X-ray crystallography of amorphous substances with Jacques Mering.</li>
  <li><strong>1950-53</strong> Started working in King's College, London, @ Biophysics Unit on X-ray diffraction on proteins + nucleic acids. <b><i> Found helical shape in 1951, but continued checking. </i></b> <i>She continued working on A-DNA and B-DNA, and it was revealed that she was the first to see the double helix in her manuscripts. </i> Watson and Crick barely gave any credit to her or Wilkins in their 1953 <i>Nature</i> publication.</li>
      <li><b>1953-1958</b> Went to Birbeck College, and worked on RNA crystallography w/ the Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) as well as the polio virus.</li>
      <li><b>1956</b> Started undergoing cancer treatments.</li>
      <li><b>1958</b> Died of (most likely) ovarian cancer, mainly because of prolonged exposure to X-ray radiation.</li>
  
    </ul>
